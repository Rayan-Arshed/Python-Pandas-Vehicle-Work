# Python Pandas Vehicle Work

##Overview
A sheet working on a dataset of vehicles and their properties, practicing common Pandas functions and manipulating the data within the frame to gain insights from the data set.


## Project Goals
To practice and further refine my coding abilities within Pandas and Python. The main goal is to work through the provided questions on the worksheet and answer the associated questions related to specific queries or processes, as well as doing some extra Data Analysis around a few variables such as drive_wheels and displacement.

## Tools and Technologies Used
### Python
### Jupyter Labs
### Pandas
- Importing data from web link
- .value_counts()
- .mean()
- & and |
- Creating subsets
- .copy()
- .sort_values()
- Using .str.contains to create a new column based on data from another column

## Repo Sections
- Jupyterlab Notebook
- Link to data set included in Notebook, also here: https://static.anaconda.cloud/shared/lms/data_analysis/Intro_to_pandas_data_analysis/assets/mpg.csv
